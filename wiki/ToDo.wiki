Feel free to comment on any of these or add some of own.

  * Replace all doubles by floats.
   * That's the default in Processing and I don't think the loss of precision will affect anyone.
  * Implement a PStyleProperty to replace the stroke, stroke color, color, ... properties.
   * This will make setting the PApplet properties easier when rendering glyphs and will avoid having to go back and forth between the Java2D and Processing constants for things like stroke caps and line joins.
  * Replace Vector3 by PVector.
   * No reason to have yet another vector implementation.
